	/// On WASM this might be different than the <see cref="Element"/>:
	/// In the case of implicit capture, the element used for the capture will prevent any pointer event on the sub-element
	/// (sub-element will actually get a pointer 'leave' on capture, and an 'enter' on capture release).
	/// So instead of capturing using the actual element, we use the 'OriginalSource' of the 'relatedArgs',
	/// so an event will still be sent to sub-elements and we will then filter them out if needed.

	///
	/// This makes sense only for a platform that has "implicit capture"
	/// (i.e. all pointers events are sent to the element on which the pointer pressed
	/// occurred at the beginning of the gesture). This is the case on iOS and Android.

	/// Gets the last event dispatched by the <see cref="Element"/>.
	/// In case of native bubbling (cf. <see cref="IsInNativeBubblingTree"/>),
	/// this helps to determine that an event was already dispatched by the Owner:
	/// if a UIElement is receiving an event with the same timestamp, it means that the element
	/// is a parent of the Owner and we are only bubbling the routed event, so this element can
	/// raise the event (if the opposite, it means that the element is a child, so it has to mute the event).
