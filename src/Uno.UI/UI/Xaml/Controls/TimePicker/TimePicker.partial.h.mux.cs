	// the end user changing a field to select the desired time. Second source is us updating
	// the itemssources and selected indices. We only want to react to the first source as the
	// second one will cause an unintentional recurrence in our logic. So we use this locking mechanism to
	// anticipate selection changes caused by us and making sure we do not react to them. It is okay
	// that these locks are not atomic since they will be only accessed by a single thread so no race
	// condition can occur.
