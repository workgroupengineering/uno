* [iOS] [WASM] `Path` now supports `LinearGradientBrush` as `Fill`
* A feature flag has been added to change the default preferred placement mode fo the drop down of the `ComboBox` (cf. ../articles/control/ComboBox.md)

### Breaking changes
* `TextBox` no longer raises TextChanged when its template is applied, in line with UWP.
* `TextBox.TextChanged` is now called asynchronously after the UI is updated, in line with UWP. For most uses `TextChanging` should be preferred.
* [Android] `TextBox.IsSpellCheckEnabled = false` is now enforced in a way that may cause issues in certain use cases (see https://stackoverflow.com/a/5188119/1902058). The old behavior can be restored by setting `ShouldForceDisableSpellCheck = false`, per `TextBox`.
* `TextBox.Text = null` will now throw an exception, as on UWP. Pushing `null` via a binding is still valid.
* Projects targeting Android 8 must now use Xamarin.GooglePlayServices.* 60.1142.1 (60.1142.0 has been unlisted)
* Projects targeting Android 9 must now use Xamarin.GooglePlayServices.* 71.1600.0
* [iOS] UIWebView is deprecated and replaced with WKWebView (ITMS-90809: Deprecated API Usage - Apple will stop accepting submissions of apps that use UIWebView APIs . See https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwebview for more information.)
* [iOS] If you set the `ManipulationMode` to something else than `System` or `All`, the [DelaysContentTouches](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscrollview/1619398-delayscontenttouches) is going to be disabled on all parent `ScrollViewer`
* [#1237] Static resources defined in App.xaml were not processed and registered properly
    > This change might break the compilation for projects that define duplicate resources in other globally accessible resource dictionaries. Adjustments to remove duplicate resources may be necessary.
 * [WASM] The transform returned by `UIElement.TransformToVisual` is now including scale, rotation or any custom transformation that was declared on a parent element (transform was only including translate components)

    > This change introduces a new constructor in `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.NativeApplication` that requests a delegate. In the Visual Studio Templates for Uno Platform, the `Main.cs` for the Android, the constructor now provides `() => new App()` instead of `new App()`, you can do the same in your existing application.
